# 1-1	What is the difference between data and information, and what makes it useful?

The Information Value Chain 
 

Events or needs generate data that can be analyzed and used to make decisions. 
 
A sales transaction occurs.
What course should I take?
Players are assigned numbers. 
 
Data are facts that describe characteristics or attributes of objects, such as people, items, or events. They are meaningless by themselves. 
 
What could these mean? 
32,546 
Teeter 
42 
 
Information is the combination of data to provide context about events or objects. 
 
32,546 + U.S. dollars + 10/2018 + Pennsylvania = "Sales in Pennsylvania in October were $32,546."
 
Teeter + instructor + AIS + 2:00pm + TuTh + Fall 2018 = "Prof. Teeter teaches AIS in Fall 2018 on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:00pm."
 
42 + Jackie Robinson + jersey + baseball = "Jackie Robinson's baseball jersey number was 42."
 
Knowledge is understanding the meaning of information to the point that you know whether it is good or bad, truthful or misleading, or the events that led to the generation of that information. 
 
Sales in Pennsylvania on October were $32,546. We had projected $30,000 in sales. We exceeded our goal by 8.4%. 
 
Prof. Teeter's Fall 2018 AIS course at 2:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays fits in my schedule. Prof. Teeter is a tough but fair professor. I need AIS for my accounting major. 
 
I'm an avid baseball collector. I collect things related to Jackie Robinson. 42 is the number of Jackie Robinson's jersey. 
 
Decisions are the application of knowledge with an anticipated result.
 
Let's determine how we beat our October sales goal in Pennsylvania and do it again in November. 
 
I'm taking Prof. Teeter's 2:00pm course because I know that his course is challenging, his exams are hard to cheat on, and I will learn a lot about accounting and emerging technologies.
 
I will buy that jersey with the number 42 on the back. 
 
Useful Information
Information is useful for decision and reporting purposes when it meets the following characteristics:
 
Relevant - makes a difference in a decision
a.	Timely - available when needed or in time to have an impact on a decision. 
b.	Predictive value - helps with forecasting the future. 
c.	Feedback value - confirms or corrects what had been predicted in the past. 
Reliable - is faithfully presented
a.	Verifiable - can be confirmed by an independent party. 
b.	Representational faithfulness - reports what actually happened. 
c.	Neutrality - information is not biased.
 
 
# 1-2	What is an accounting information system?
 
An Accounting Information System is a group of processes that works together to record transactions and generate reports of financial and nonfinancial activity within a firm and its partners that help managers make decisions. 

It includes 4 related main tasks:

  
Input is where you capture data. It could be manual data entry or an automatic procedure
Processing
Storage
Output

 
An AIS involves 6 components:
 
People interact with the system.
Users input data and perform calculations.
Accountants generate and review transactions.
Managers use the systems to plan and control activity.
Managers review and approve activity.
Chief financial officers sign off on the reported numbers.
Business analysts try to understand business events.
Designers identify system requirements, evaluate feasibility, and build an interface for people to interact with.
Consultants help improve processes.
Evaluators test the system and data for process and quality issues 
Auditors evaluate the data and systems to make sure they are presented fairly. 
IT auditors identify weaknesses in internal controls over the system.
Procedures are the methods for recording, processing, storing, and retrieving data. 
Manual procedures are performed by hand. 
Reviewing a purchase order for approval.
Automated procedures are performed automatically on a schedule. 
Checking a user's password when they log in. 
Data are the facts related to transactions and objects. 
Databases store accounting data. 
sales orders, customer billing statements, sales analysis reports, purchase requisitions, vendor invoices, check registers, general ledger, inventory data, payroll information, timekeeping, tax information
 
Software is the computer programs used to record, process, store, and retrieve data. 
QuickBooks, Wave, SAP, Oracle
 
Information Technology Infrastructure includes the physical devices needed to record, process, store, and retrieve data.  
Hardware
Computers, mobile devices, printers, hard drives, power supplies
Network
Servers, routers, wireless access points
Cloud
Everything as a service
 
Internal Controls are security measures that protect sensitive data.

# 1-3	How is the role of accountants changing?
 
While the CPA (AICPA) is still the standard certification for the accounting profession, additional certifications show specialized knowledge. 
 
Accountants are now [Business analysts]
[Prepare, Develop, Use, Manage]
 
# 1-4	What tools do accountants need to understand?
 
Spreadsheets (e.g. Excel, Sheets) are used to quickly arrange and manipulate data for users.
Need to know: 
Advantages: Easy for beginners, organize small data, robust calculations, sharing
Disadvantages: Most people don't like them, important data are hidden, difficult to analyze, loss of historical data, difficult to share
 
 
Queries - SQL is used every day. It's like VLOOKUP for databases.
Scripting - Pick one: Python or R
Visualization - Pick one: Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView
 
# 1-5	What does the accounting cycle look like in a computerized system?
 
[P2P, Prod, O2C, Controlling, Documents, Master, Transaction]
[Master, Transactions, Accruals, Reports]
